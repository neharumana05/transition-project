        Healthy Diet: 
        <p>A healthy diet is a diet that maintains or improves overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients such as protein, micronutrients such as vitamins, and adequate fibre and food energy.

            A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no ultra-processed foods or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although additional sources of vitamin B12 are needed for those following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.</p>

        Un-Healthy Diet:
        <p>Junk food is a term for food containing high levels of calories from sugar and/or bad fat with less protein, good fat, fibre, vitamins or minerals.

            The term describes that a particular food has less nutrition value and contains a lot of bad fat, sugar, salt and calories. "Junk food" can also refer to high protein food with large amounts of meat. For example, It is prepared with too much bad fat. Hamburgers, fried chicken, and candies are examples of junk food. Most of the fast food belongs to junk food, and most junk food is fast food, too.
            
            There are concerns about the negative health effects resulting from a junk food-heavy diet. Especially fatness has resulted in public health awareness campaigns, and in restrictions on advertisements and sales in several countries.</p>
